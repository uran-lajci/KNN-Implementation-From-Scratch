AI Assignment to build the KNN algorithm for regression from scratch

The given code in this repo performs k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression on a dataset. It calculates the Euclidean distance between a test sample and each training sample to determine the nearest neighbors. The number of nearest neighbors, k, is set to 3. The code then predicts the target value of the test sample by taking the average of the target values of the nearest neighbors. The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated by comparing the predicted target value with the actual target value. Finally, the prediction and MSE are printed.
